# Client-Side Error Fixes for Punjab Heritage Store

## Issue Description
Your ecommerce store at punjabijuttiandfulkari.com was showing a client-side exception error that prevented the site from loading properly.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Firebase Analytics Hydration Issues**: Firebase Analytics was being loaded during SSR causing hydration mismatches
2. **Socket.IO Connection Errors**: Socket connections failing in production were causing unhandled exceptions
3. **localStorage Access**: Client-side storage access during SSR was causing hydration issues
4. **React 19 Compatibility**: Some components had compatibility issues with React 19
5. **Missing Error Boundaries**: No error boundaries to catch and handle client-side exceptions gracefully

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`lib/firebase.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed Analytics Loading**: Added proper browser-only loading with error handling
- ✅ **Added Support Check**: Analytics only loads if supported by the browser
- ✅ **Prevented SSR Issues**: Analytics loading is now completely client-side

### 2. Error Boundaries (`components/error-boundary.tsx`)
- ✅ **Added Global Error Boundary**: Catches all unhandled React errors
- ✅ **User-Friendly Error Display**: Shows bilingual error messages (Punjabi/English)
- ✅ **Development vs Production**: Different error details based on environment
- ✅ **Recovery Options**: Users can retry or go home

### 3. Layout Updates (`app/layout.tsx`)
- ✅ **Wrapped with Error Boundary**: All pages now have error protection
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when errors occur

### 4. Socket.IO Improvements (`hooks/useSocket.ts`)
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Socket connection failures don't crash the app
- ✅ **Client-Side Only**: Socket initialization only happens in browser
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: App works without socket connection
- ✅ **Reduced Console Noise**: Better logging for development vs production

### 5. Cart Context Fixes (`contexts/CartContext.tsx`)
- ✅ **localStorage Safety**: Proper client-side checks before accessing localStorage
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Corrupted cart data is automatically cleared
- ✅ **Hydration Safety**: Cart initialization waits for client-side hydration

### 6. Firebase Auth Context (`contexts/FirebaseAuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error catching and user feedback
- ✅ **Cleanup Safety**: Proper cleanup of auth listeners
- ✅ **State Management**: More robust authentication state handling

### 7. Client Wrapper Component (`components/client-wrapper.tsx`)
- ✅ **Hydration Protection**: Prevents hydration mismatches
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator during hydration
- ✅ **Fallback Support**: Customizable fallback content

### 8. Error Page (`app/error.tsx`)
- ✅ **Next.js Error Page**: Catches page-level errors
- ✅ **Bilingual Support**: Error messages in Punjabi and English
- ✅ **Recovery Actions**: Reset and home navigation options
- ✅ **Development Info**: Detailed error info in development mode

### 9. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- ✅ **React Strict Mode**: Better error detection in development
- ✅ **Production Optimizations**: Better error handling in production

### 10. Environment Configuration
- ✅ **Production Environment**: Proper environment variable setup
- ✅ **Error Reporting Ready**: Prepared for error monitoring services
