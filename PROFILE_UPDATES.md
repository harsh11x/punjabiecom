# Profile Page Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Settings Button
- Removed the settings button from the profile sidebar
- Replaced it with a logout button for better user experience

### 2. Added Logout Functionality
- Added a logout button in the profile sidebar
- Button is styled with red color to indicate it's a destructive action
- Uses the existing `signOut` function from Firebase Auth Provider
- Redirects user to login page after successful logout

### 3. Enhanced Orders Section
- **Profile Page**: Added a "Recent Orders" section showing the last 3 orders
- **Orders Page**: Updated to use real API data instead of mock data
- Both pages now display real-time order information including:
  - Order status with visual indicators
  - Tracking numbers (when available)
  - Payment information
  - Shipping details
  - Order items with images and details

### 4. New API Endpoint
- Created `/api/user/orders` endpoint for fetching user-specific orders
- Endpoint requires Firebase authentication token
- Returns orders with tracking information and status updates
- Automatically syncs with admin panel updates

### 5. Real-time Order Tracking
- Orders now show live status updates
- Tracking numbers are displayed when available
- Status badges with appropriate colors and icons
- Order history with detailed information

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Admin SDK
- Installed `firebase-admin` package
- Created `lib/firebase-admin.ts` for server-side authentication
- Configured to work with both service account and individual credentials

### API Structure
```typescript
// User Orders API
GET /api/user/orders
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>

Response:
{
  success: boolean,
  orders: Order[]
}
```

### Order Interface
```typescript
interface Order {
  _id: string
  orderNumber: string
  status: string
  paymentStatus: string
  paymentMethod: string
  total: number
  items: OrderItem[]
  shippingAddress: ShippingAddress
  trackingNumber?: string
  trackingStatus: string
  trackingColor: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}
```

## Admin Panel Integration

The admin panel can now update order statuses and tracking numbers, and these changes are automatically reflected in the user's profile and orders pages:

1. **Admin updates order** → Changes saved to database
2. **User refreshes profile/orders** → New API call fetches updated data
3. **Real-time updates** → User sees current order status and tracking info

## Environment Setup

Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```bash
# Firebase Admin SDK
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your-service-account-json
# OR
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key

# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can now track their orders in real-time
2. **Improved Security**: Proper authentication for order data access
3. **Real-time Updates**: Order status changes from admin panel are immediately visible
4. **Professional Look**: Clean, modern interface with proper status indicators
5. **Easy Logout**: Users can easily sign out from their profile

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/profile` (requires authentication)
3. Check that the settings button is gone and logout button is present
4. Verify that recent orders are displayed (if any exist)
5. Test logout functionality
6. Navigate to `/orders` to see the full orders page with real data

## Future Enhancements

- Add real-time notifications for order status changes
- Implement order cancellation functionality
- Add order return/refund requests
- Include estimated delivery dates
- Add order history filtering and search
